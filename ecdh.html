            <h1>Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman</h1>
            <article>
                Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange protocol. 
                It is used when two parties wish to compute some shared secret which can be used for symmetric cryptography. 
                It is based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but uses elliptic curves to provide better security.

            <h5>Diffie Hellman Overview</h5>
            <article>
                Diffie Hellman is a key exchange protocol invented by cryptographyers Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. 
                It is useful when two parties want to create a shared secret when communicating over an unsecure channel. 
                Created in 1976, it was the first ever public key cryptosystem. 
                For two parties named Alice and Bob, the protocol works as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice & Bob agree publicly to a prime modulus (p) and a base (g) which is coprime to p.</li>
                    <li>Alice chooses a random integer a to be her secret key, and Bob chooses a random integer b as his.</li>
                    <li>Alice computes A = g<sup>a</sup> mod p, Bob computes B = g<sup>b</sup> mod p, and both parties publish this value.</li>
                    <li>To find the shared secret s, Alice computes s = B<sup>a</sup> mod p, and Bob computes s = A<sup>b</sup> mod p.</li>
                </ol>
                This technique works to arrive at the same value for s because modular exponentiation is associative, meaning the result is not impacted by the order in which exponents are applied.
                In this case, Alice's value for s is equal to (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup> mod p, and Bob's value is (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> mod p, which are equivalent.
                Now consider the viewpoint of an attacker; the only information shared publicly during this protocol is p, g, A, & B. 
                There are no known algorithms that are able to compute s efficiently given only these parameters. 
                As a result, for large key sizes, it is infeasible for an attacker to break this cipher.
                Bob and Alice can now use s for symmetric encryption.

            <h5>Elliptic Curves and Group Theory</h5>
            <article>
                Before we can delve into the ECDH protocol, we must first establish some mathematical preliminaries to understand the operations being performed.
                Let's begin by defining an elliptic curve. 
                An elliptic curve is a curve of the form y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b, where a and b are constants and 4a<sup>3</sup> + 27b<sup>2</sup> â‰  0.

            <h5>How ECDH works</h5>
            <article>
                Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman relies on analogous concepts and techniques, but uses elliptic curve operations as a stronger trapdoor function.
                Suppose Alice and Bob now wish to instead use ECDH to find a shared secret.
                Once again, they will first decide upon a prime modulus.
