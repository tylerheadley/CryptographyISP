        <h1>Building a Web App for Text Encryption</h1>

          The goal of this ISP is to combine two different areas that interest me: 
          cybersecurity and web development. To achieve this goal, I have decided to build a website 
          that is capable of taking in a text input and outputting a ciphertext using various encryption standards.

          To begin the project, I familiarized myself with the basics of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 
          These languages are commonly used for web development. 
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as the skeleton of any website, giving the browser information about
          what content a website will contain. JavaScript (not to be confused with Java) 
          is a programming language that runs on the client side and can be used to manipulate HTML elements to make websites interactive.
          This website used JavaScript to read user inputs and run algorithms that compute a ciphertext based off of those inputs. 
          Finally, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for defining properties of HTML elements, such as color, position, font, and more,
          to make websites more visually appealing.

          When you use any website, the host of that website sends files to your computer (the client), which are then rendered 
          by whatever browser you are using. To do this, our the host communicates with the client over the internet, using a protocol 
          called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). You have probably seen HTTP, or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) prepended
          to URLs. The host of a website is a computer or server that contains and transmits files for a web page. 
          While it is possible for me to configure my laptop to host this website directly, generally small machines aren't powerful enough. 
          This website is instead hosted through a service called GitHub Pages.

          One limitation of GitHub is that it is currently only capable of hosting static websites. Static websites are fast and stable, but do not
          allow content to change based on user interaction or for the host to receive information from the client. Dynamic websites are more complex,
          but also grant the host more advanced features.

          This project implements four encryption algorithms. The first, a Caesar Cipher, is by far the simplest of them all. RSA, invented in the 1970's,
          was a revolutionary innovation for its time and is still widely used today for key exchange between parties. Advancements in computing power and algorithms
          have made RSA less secure for small key sizes, leading to the development of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which provides greater security than 
          RSA at equivalent key size. Finally, Advanced Encryption Standard is a symmetric cryptosystem that is also widely used for secure communication.
